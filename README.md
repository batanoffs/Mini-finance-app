The project aims to simulate online banking. Generate online debit card for new user, top up the account via existing credit card, make transactions to other users in the ecosystem and keep track of history.
Booststrap is removed from the original template and refactored. Added colour pallet, fonts, login/register, home page, photo authentication. The aim is to practice css/html and responsive design.
