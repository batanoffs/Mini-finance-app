# Mini Finance Innovations [LIVE DEMO](https://batanoffs.github.io/mini-finance/)

This is a finance web application project. The goal is to simulate online banking by generating online virtual cards for new users, enabling account top-ups via the user's debit card, adding friends, facilitating transactions between users, and maintaining transaction history. The main focus of this project is to practice REST, React, React-router, ES6 features, CSS/CSS modules, and responsive design.
